# Team-Profile-Generator

This assignment required use of testing Javascript code using node.js in the application terminal. The purpose of this assignment is to create a Javascript application that builds an employee database for 4 types of employees: a general employee, an intern, an engineer and a manager. Building a repository and linking it to the coding terminal was the first step in building this application. The second step was to build files in a Test folder and then test each file using Jest for each employee type. Within each file is Javascript which asks the following for employees: name, office number, e-mail address, school and in some cases a GitHub profile link. The application uses Inquirer for collecting input from the end-user. Each file was tested using Jest prior to launching Inquirer.
