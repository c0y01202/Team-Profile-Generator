# Team-Profile-Generator

This assignment required use of testing Javascript code using node.js in the application terminal. The purpose of this assignment is to create a Javascript application that builds an employee database for 4 types of employees: a general employee, an intern, an engineer and a manager. Building a repository and linking it to the coding terminal was the first step in building this application. The second step was to build files in a Test folder and then test each file using Jest for each employee type. Within each file is are Javascript functions which ask the following categories of information for each type of employee: name, office number, e-mail address, school and in some cases a GitHub profile link. The application uses Inquirer for collecting input from the end-user. Each file was tested using Jest prior to launching Inquirer.

# Using Jest to Test Application Code

The following video link demonstrates files being tested using Jest in Visual Studio: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KmWsVub_MWPkhBiOODXi6Vc5RDpozonm/view

# Inquirer and Output/HTML File

Once tests were passed with Jest using node.js, an output file was created with an HTML template which Inquirer populated with data. Inquirer was run for all 3 types of employees and data that matched their employee type was entered with prompts and answers in the terminal. The following link is a video which shows how Inquirer populated the output HTML file with data: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pvFCuI7czL6ZwEdszmEAssPbcwdAmbH8/view
